# MachineLearningBasics

**KNN Classification**:

Focused on the Vertebral Column dataset, using KNN for binary classification of normal vs. abnormal spines. I performed EDA (scatterplots, boxplots), built learning curves, compared distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, Chebyshev, Mahalanobis), and tested weighted voting.

**Linear Regression**:

Used the Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset. I performed EDA, summary statistics, simple and multiple linear regression, tested nonlinearities and interactions, compared model fits, and evaluated KNN regression versus linear regression.

**Time Series I**:

introduced time series feature extraction from AReM activity recognition data. I derived time-domain features (min, max, mean, quartiles, std), built bootstrap confidence intervals, and identified important predictors.

**Time Series II**:

Extended this to binary and multiclass classification using logistic regression, L1-penalized regression, multinomial regression, and Na√Øve Bayes. I evaluated performance with confusion matrices, ROC/AUC, cross-validation, and feature selection.

**Decision Trees**:

Focuses on decision trees for interpretable modeling using the Acute Inflammations dataset, and regression techniques (LASSO, ridge, PCR, boosting) on the Communities and Crime dataset, including data imputation, feature selection, and model evaluation.

**SMOTE**:

Involves tree-based methods on the APS Failure dataset, addressing missing data, class imbalance, and applying Random Forest, XGBoost with L1-penalized logistic regression, and SMOTE. It also includes questions from ISLR.

**SVM**:

Covers multi-label classification using SVMs on the Anuran Calls dataset via binary relevance, with evaluation using exact match and Hamming scores, and includes k-means clustering with Monte-Carlo simulation to assess clustering performance using Hamming distance and related metrics. Several exercises are marked as extra practice.
